		<p class=info>Simply put, open-source programming is merely writing code that other people can freely use and alter. 
		The source code is usually released under a license 
		in which the copyright holder grants users rights to modify and distribute the code to anyone<sup>1</sup>. 
		According to the Open Source Initiative<sup>2</sup>, or OSI, the source code of an open source computer program 
		is made available free of cost to the public so that a larger group of programmers 
		can improve upon the code and share the changes with the public. 
		One of the most well-known open-source softwares, or OSS, is the Linux kernel<sup>3</sup>, 
		which was started by Linus Torvalds and released as a freely modifiable source code in 1991.
